**The Terminal Tinkerer** is a blog site that publishes guides and technical deep dives on cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and modern software development/delivery practices.

Hi, my name is Sid. I'm a developer with a passion for learning and writing. Welcome to my blog!

I started my journey as a *software developer* in 2018 and have since expanded into *software delivery and cloud infrastructure management*. During that time I've collaborated with customers during application implementation phases and worked with technical teams to solve *system integration* challenges. These days I focus on *infrastructure management and developer productivity* while managing *software deployment on private cloud and on-prem cloud environments*. Wearing multiple hats in a small-to-medium scale business is where I get my fix for solving problems.

If you're curious about cloud technologies, container orchestration, and modern software delivery then stick around! Explore the blog and let's connect!

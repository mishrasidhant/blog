# Why start a blog?
- To capture my mistakes and wins as I tinker with tech 
- To share ideas and create guides for others who may stumble along the same path
- To learn from your feedback

I enjoy working on problems that challenge me, but once I solve them, I quickly move on to the next challenge. Over time, I forget some of the interesting things I've worked on in the past. This blog will serve as a personal archive. Encouraging me to review my notes and reflect on the lessons I've learned over the years and share them with you.

Welcome to my corner of the internet. My goal is to bring value to someone else's journey and grow myself in the process.

## What to expect
- Technical deep dives: Exploring topics in tech with detailed breakdowns
- How to guides: Step by step tutorials for solving practical problems
- Lessons learned: Share both success and failures along the way

## Goals
1. To have a positive impact on at least one person
2. Receive feedback from the community
3. Learn through writing and discussion

## How do I measure success?
Success for me is defined by the encouragement and feedback I receive from you! Your thoughts,  questions, and insights will shape and improve this blog. Please feel free to reach out!

If any of my posts help you, or spark an idea, I'd love to hear about it!
